# Adding a benchmark: the evolution plugin contract

The unified entry `python -m raven.evolver run --config <yaml>` runs the SOP
self-evolution loop on any registered benchmark (methodology:
[`self-evolution-loop-sop.md`](self-evolution-loop-sop.md); implementation
mapping: [`self-evolution-loop-raven-mapping.md`](self-evolution-loop-raven-mapping.md)).
This document answers: what do you build to make *your* benchmark evolvable?
Reference implementation: `raven/benchmarks/appworld/evolve/entry.py`
(built-in scorer line). User-facing docs live in `raven/evolver/README.md`.

## What you bring (bench side)

| # | Deliverable | Shape | Hard requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Scorer** | subprocess-invokable: given a task list, K attempts, and a checkout of the candidate code, write **one result file per trial** | Result files must distinguish "task failed" from "infrastructure failed" (an infra marker) — this feeds Gate-f and the fixed-denominator rule |
| 2 | **Result reader** | result files -> `TaskEval(task_id, passes, attempts, infra_attempts)` | Idempotent: re-reading the same directory yields the same evals |
| 3 | **Trajectories** | one renderable execution record per attempt, plus a "failing attempt -> diagnosis text" renderer | Diagnosis only ever reads train-side trajectories |
| 4 | **Task split** | train / test id lists (files or inline) | A test list enables the sealed flow; train∩test must be empty (checked at startup) |
| 5 | **Editable-path whitelist** | which path prefixes of the subject repo the designer may edit | Every prefix must match files at `base_sha` or the run refuses to start (prevents silently-dropped edits) |

Optional: an environment precheck (pre-run health gate), a WHY taxonomy
(omitted -> induced automatically from vanilla failures), per-WHY focused
subsets (targeted probing).

**Two different models, do not conflate:** the *subject's* model (what the
benchmarked agent runs on — pinned inside your scorer config for the whole
run, same-regime rule) and the loop's driver/design/verdict models (the yaml
`models:` section; omitted -> Raven's own configured model).

## Implementation shape: one `build()` function

In your package (e.g. `raven/benchmarks/<name>/evolve/entry.py`):

```python
from raven.evolver.launch.contract import BenchBundle, LaunchContext, validate_whitelist

def build(ctx: LaunchContext) -> BenchBundle:
    spec = ctx.spec            # bench/repo_root/base_sha/work_dir/funnel/bench_config
    bc = spec.bench_config     # your own yaml section; you own its schema
    validate_whitelist(spec.repo_root, spec.base_sha, whitelist)
    return BenchBundle(
        root_node_id="C0",
        root_node=...,          # HarnessNode anchored at base_sha
        journal_path=spec.work_dir / "journal" / "rounds.jsonl",
        cold_start_total=len(train_ids) * spec.funnel.k_confirm,
        cold_start_done=...,    # count existing vanilla trial result files
        run_cold_start=...,     # idempotent: fill missing trials only
        build_orchestrator=..., # assemble EvolutionOrchestrator (EvalBackend + gate)
        unseal=...,             # only with a test set; journal records -> report dict
    )
```

Register it: `raven.evolver.launch.registry.BENCHES["<name>"] = "your.module:build"`.

Framework pieces you reuse instead of rewriting:

- `make_worktree_eval_fn` — candidate commit -> ephemeral worktree checkout;
  you only implement "score this directory on these tasks";
- `eval_with_infra_rerun` — the SOP §0 infra rerun ladder (<=2 reruns, KEPT rule);
- `compute_stability` / `simple_anchor` / `select_anchor` — cold-start
  bucketing and anchor selection;
- two gate policies: `PairedTwoSigmaGate` (generic anchor screen) and
  `FocusedFisherGate` (per-WHY targeted probe);
- `SealedTestRunner` + `unseal_retention` — the sealed test / retention suite.

## Idempotency requirements (what resume stands on)

The resume model is "artifacts are the state": `run_cold_start` and your eval
path must, on re-invocation, only fill missing trials (an existing parseable
result file == that trial is done; a half-written file must be re-run). Round
granularity is covered by the journal replay. If your scorer skips existing
result files, interruption/resume works with no further effort.

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] `run --smoke` completes one round (pin 2-3 known-failing tasks in the
      yaml `smoke:` section)
- [ ] Ctrl-C mid-run, re-run the same command: completed trials are not re-run
- [ ] `status` at each of the three phases; no test numbers ever appear
- [ ] Put a wrong prefix in the whitelist: the run must refuse to start
